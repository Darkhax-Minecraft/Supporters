This mod provides modpacks and other players with a way to incorporate their supporters into the game experience. Supporters can be loaded from a variety of sources that are defined in the config file. These supporters can then be accessed by other mods and CraftTweaker scripts. For example, you can use this mod to create player heads for all your supporters, and then give zombies a chance to spawn wearing a random head item. An example of this can be found here.

You can add players from the following supporters
- Directly added to the config file.
- Online links to lists of UUIDs. (example)
- Twitch Subscribers. (Not Yet Implemented)
- Patreon Supporters. (Not Yet Implemented)
